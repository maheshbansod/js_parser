# JS Parser

This repository contains a JavaScript parser with TypeScript support too probably, developed purely for personal use in another project.

**Please Note:**

*   This parser is **not intended to be compliant** with any official JavaScript specifications (e.g., ECMAScript) or to mimic the behavior of well-known parsers. Its design and implementation are driven solely by the specific needs of my personal project.
*   This project is currently **under active development**. Functionality is incomplete, and APIs may change frequently.

**Current Status:**

The parser currently includes a tokenizer capable of recognizing basic JavaScript tokens (keywords, identifiers, literals, operators, punctuators) and a preliminary parser that can identify "atom" expressions (identifiers, number literals, string literals).
